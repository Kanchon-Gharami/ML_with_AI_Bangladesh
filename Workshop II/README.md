# Workshop-II: Learn Machine Learning

Welcome to Workshop-II of our comprehensive Machine Learning course. In this workshop, we delve into the essential projects of Classical Machine Learning (ML) and concepts of Deep Learning (DL), and engage in hands-on coding exercises that will provide a practical understanding of how to implement ML models.

## Contents

1. **Hands on Coding!**:This segment includes practical coding exercises on:
   - **Play Golf Classification**: A project to classify if players play golf or not using naive bayes classifier.
   - **Lung Cancer Classification**: An exercise to classify if lung cancer from given attributes using naive bayes classifier.

2. **Evaluation Method**: Confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

3. **Neural Network**: Introduction of deep learning, problem with classical machine learning, perceptron algorithm, MLP and several version of neural networks.

## Resources
