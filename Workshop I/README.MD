# Workshop-I: Foundations of ML & AI and Hands-on Projects

Welcome to Workshop-I of our comprehensive Machine Learning course. In this workshop, we delve into the essential concepts of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), and engage in hands-on coding exercises that will provide a practical understanding of how to implement ML models.

## Contents

1. **Concepts Of ML & AI**: We begin with a fundamental overview of what ML and AI are, their distinctions from traditional programming, and how machines learn and analyze patterns. We also explore the classifications of ML, its applications, and the plethora of career and research opportunities in this field.

2. **ML Projects Pipeline**: Participants will gain insight into the typical workflow of ML projects, starting from understanding the dataset, preprocessing data, extracting features, splitting data into training and test sets, training ML models, and finally, evaluating their performance.

3. **Hands-on Coding**: This segment includes practical coding exercises on:
   - **Cricketer Classification**: An exercise to classify cricketers using machine learning techniques.
   - **Neural Style Transfer**: A project that combines the content of one image with the style of another using Convolutional Neural Networks.

## Resources

- **Dataset**: `cricket_dataset.csv` - The dataset used for the cricketer classification project.
- **Documentation**: `Project_Report.pdf` - A comprehensive report detailing the projects, methodologies, and findings.
- **Notebooks**:
  - `Cricketer_Classification.ipynb` - Jupyter/Colab notebook for the cricketer classification project.
  - `Neural_Style_Transfer.ipynb` - Jupyter/Colab notebook for the neural style transfer project.
- **Slides**: `Pitch Deck.pdf` - The complete slide deck for this workshop, covering all topics and hands-on exercises.
